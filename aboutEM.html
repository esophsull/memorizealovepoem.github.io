  <h1>About Edwin Morgan</h1>
  <p>
    Edwin Morgan was born in Glasgow in 1920. In 2004, he was crowned Makar, making him the first national poet of Scotland, a position which he held until the year of his death in 2010. He translated works from Hungarian, Russian, Latin and other languages into English, including his 1952 translation of <em>Beowulf</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Morgan was beloved by poets around the world and by his fellow Glaswegians, who crowned him the first Glasgow Poet Laureate in 1999.
