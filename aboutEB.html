  <h1>About Elizabeth Bishop</h1>
  <p>
    Elizabeth Bishop was born in 1911. She was born in Worcester and died in Boston, Massachusetts sixty-eight years later, after extensive time abroad. Her childhood was spent living with grandparents in Nova Scotia, and much of her adult life was spent in Brazil with a long-term partner, Brazillian architect Lota de Macedo Soares. </p>
    
    <p>Beyond her own poetry, Bishop was a translator of Ancient Greek, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Notable translations include works by Clarice Lispector, Alice Brant, and Octavio Paz. Upon her return to the United States, Bishop held teaching positions at the University of Washington, Harvard University, and MIT. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Bishop published six volumes of poetry in her lifetime, in addition to fiction, non-fiction prose, and paintings, which often illustrated her travels. She was the eighth U.S. Poet Laureate, preceded by her close friend and collaborator, Robert Lowell, who was the sixth.
