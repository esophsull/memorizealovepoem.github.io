    Following the death of her husband, politician Henry Lincoln Johnson, Georgia established the S Street Salon out of their family home in Washington D.C. Johnson's weekly salons were attended by major figures of the Harlem Renaissance, including Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Jessie Faucet, and many others-- attendees were known as the "Saturday Nighters."
